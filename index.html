    <p class="five">A site which allows the user to search for cars for sale from an inventory that has been added to the database by different users. One can search for cars based on single categories of make, model, state, or a combination of two or more of these variables. When a user is registered and logged in, they can then add cars they are looking to sell, as well as comments or articles about the site.</p>

    <h5 class="fours"><u>Search Engine</u></h5>
    <p class="five">A program designed to mimic the functions of major search engines, such as Google, by using the duckduckgo API. The search engine provides answers to users in two ways. Although it does not produce the kind of detail-specific searches like those of Google, it does handle general and more common searches quite well. The initial search displays several subcategores of the queried subject. One is then able to click on one of these subheadings to get the most specific information about the topic from the API.</p>
